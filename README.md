# salon-management-booking-system
this is my final year project assignment and also my biggest solo project , this is what its about.
this is a php and html based project its a system that allows users to book appointments , purchase products , make payments (because this is a protoytype , im using zynles api sandbox for payment) and the issuance of an e-recipt afterwards.
users/non-admins can view dashboard and will only be required to signup/login when they want to make a booking or purchase a product.
users are required to pay on 2 instanes when purchasing an item and when bookinng an appoinment (to secure a slot).
